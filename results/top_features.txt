INTERPRETATION
==============

These feature importances reveal that LendingClub's grading system heavily weighs:
1. The borrower's existing financial obligations (debt-to-income ratio)
2. Income level and stability
3. Past credit behavior and history
4. Geographic and demographic factors

This suggests the P2P lending platform uses similar risk factors to traditional
banks, but may weight them differently or combine them in novel ways.
