    Load and prepare loan data with a feature set designed to avoid data leakage

    1. Loads the loan data
    2. Creates a binary target for good grades (A/B) vs poor grades (C-G)
    3. Selects only borrower characteristics that would be available pre-loan
    4. Cleans and transforms features for machine learning
    
    RATIONALE FOR FEATURE SELECTION:
    ------------------------------------
    In real-world lending, grade prediction must be made BEFORE the loan is issued.
    Therefore, we exclude post-origination features like:
    - interest_rate (this is derived FROM the grade, not a predictor of it)
    - loan_status (unknown at origination time)
    - payment history features (not available before loan is issued)
    
    Instead, we focus on borrower characteristics that would be available during
    the loan application process, creating a realistic predictive scenario.

    Main execution pipeline for loan grade prediction
    
    This function:
    1. Loads and prepares loan data with careful feature selection
    2. Splits data into training and testing sets
    3. Creates classification models (logistic regression and random forest)
    4. Trains and evaluates models using multiple performance metrics
    5. Generates visualizations and insights from the results
    
    ACADEMIC CONTEXT:
    -----------------
    This implementation relates to the paper on "P2P and banking" by:
    - Focusing only on factors available before loan approval (realistic prediction)
    - Analyzing which borrower characteristics predict loan grades
    - Providing insights into how P2P platforms assess credit risk compared to traditional banks
    - Demonstrating good machine learning practices with clear documentation
    
    Returns:
        The best performing trained model pipeline
